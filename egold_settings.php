//NODE SETTING
//Website requires IP address and establishing MySQL database. IP address and data from database should be added to the file: egold_settings.php
//The root folder of web-hosting addressed by IP should store files and folders: egold.php, egold_settings.php, egold_crypto
//After placing files and folders and adjusting setting to egold_settings.php, you should address egold.php script via browser using http://[ip_address_node]/egold.php check if the installation is successful. In this case you get a message with install_bd parameter marked true.
//To run the node add egold.php with synch parameter in the form of cron '/[folder path with php]/php ~/[folder path with egold.php]/egold.php synch' at a performing interval of 1 per minute (PHP script corn version should be at least 7.1). Alternative usage: http://[ip_address_node]/egold.php?type=synch (not recommended)
//Once the synchronization is completed, in request http://[ip_address_node]/egold.php, datelasttransaction parameter will surpass zero. Synchronization is completed when the datelasttransaction parameter value becomes equal or close to datelasttransaction parameter of synchronized nodes.

//In case node is tied to a wallet it adds +1% to growth in coin amount on a certain wallet and 1 coin from each node transaction. Node activation requires making any transaction through the node via certain wallet after its synchronization with other nodes. In the process, in requesting http://[ip_address_node]/egold.php holder will be indicated with the number of the tied wallet. In a few minutes after the synchronization in requesting http://[ip_address_node]/egold.php?type=wallet&wallet=[number of related wallet] at a current node and at synchronized nodes in nodawallet parameter the IP address of the wallet’s node will be shown and the official eGOLD.html will display G+ bonus next to the balance, and the settings will demonstrate a line with IP address of the node.
//Assessment of G+ bonus is carried out during any inbound and outbound transaction of a wallet tied to node as well as during enrolment of percentage at a wallet, and actually this is 5% assessment instead of 4%. The assessment of bonus also occurs at any transaction within a wallet’s node but at least once every 24 hours if G+balance accounts 1 or more coins as each transaction within a node brings the wallet tied to it 1 coin, and this coin immediately goes to the account of the wallet. This is done so that the assessment of percentages on a wallet’s account would not be interfered with numerous transactions on node. 
//Any transaction sent from a wallet tied to a certain node and directed to some other node deactivates the node. If a node comprises less than 100 coins it will not be taken into account while voting for the transaction verification and its IP may be tied to another wallet, and there will be no its instant synchronization with other nodes. In order to maintain the node’s operating condition, at least one transaction a month should pass through the node, and the wallet balance should be at least 100 coins.

//Number of a node’s wallet should be of the following type: G-1000-00000-0000-00000 or 100000000000000000
